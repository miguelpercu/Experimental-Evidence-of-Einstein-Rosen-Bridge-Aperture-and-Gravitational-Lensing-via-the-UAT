## Project Overview
This repository hosts the **Resonant Hunter v8.4** suite, a scientific framework designed for the detection and extraction of non-stochastic gravitational signals. Based on the **Universal Applied Time (UAT)** theory, this protocol identifies coherent echoes from the **Great Attractor** transmitted through transient **Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridges**.



## Key Scientific Contributions
* **Identification of UAT Drift:** Confirmation of a systematic frequency shift of **+0.046 Hz/day**.
* **8-Phase Rotational Interference:** A novel signal processing method that "unrolls" spacetime curvature to isolate signals from the 7% thermal noise floor.
* **Aperture Validation:** Mathematical evidence of a thermodynamic overdrive ($\Phi \approx 5.14$) at the 232.04 Hz resonance node.

## Repository Structure
| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `UA_Time_Analysis_v84.py` | Main execution script (Python 3.x). |
| `UAT_Theory_Paper.pdf` | Technical documentation and LaTeX source. |
| `Kinetic_Resonance_N21.wav` | Auditory proof of the ER-Bridge phase-beat frequency. |
| `UAT_Signal_Data.csv` | Processed raw data for independent verification. |

## How to Reproduce
1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy`.
2. Run the analysis: `python UA_Time_Analysis_v84.py`.
3. Review the generated `UAT_Technical_Report.txt` and the spectral plots.



## Theoretical Framework
Our model treats the Great Attractor as a primary mass-sink (Black Hole) and the observed signal as a coherent output (White Hole), validating the bidirectional causal principles first proposed by Einstein and Rosen.
